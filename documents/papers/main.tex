\begin{abstract}
    Since 2002 the way to increase performance is by using multiple cores and
    the number of cores keeps increasing. Utilizing the full potential of the
    entire processor in a parallel way is very difficult for programmers. This
    paper discusses various papers that describe parallel programming models
    that are designed helping programmers to increase the performance of their
    programs. Finally we've compared the solution by performance, ease of use
    and scaling.
