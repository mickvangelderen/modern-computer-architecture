    For the practical assignment of the Modern Computer Architecture course
    we've changed the x264 program. We've profiled x264 and extracted the
    \satd{} as kernel function. To get a performance improvement we've moved
    the execution of the kernel function to the \rvex{}, a co-processor of the
    Microblaze. A requirement for this is to load the program into the
    instruction memory and write and read the data to and from the data memory.
    We've found that our implementation did not generate a performance
    increase, but rather a decrease. We think this is due to the communication
    overhead.
