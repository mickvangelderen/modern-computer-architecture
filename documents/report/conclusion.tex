\section{Conclusion}

We've identified a kernel function and changed the x264 program so the kernel
is executed on the \rvex. The kernel we used is the \satd function. Using our
abstracted \texttt{rvex*} functions you can write the instruction memory, write
and read the data memory and start the \rvex. Unfortunately we didn't see a
speedup, instead we even saw a decrease in performance. Assumably this is
because of the communication overhead. The \satd function is called many times.
Maybe by sending more data at once, and thus executing the \rvex less times
might improve the performance.

Using our \texttt{rvex*} functions, we were able to create different test
programs which helped us testing the communication and get to know the
platform, getting the endianness right and fixing multiple executions of the
\rvex.
