\section{Communication}

We have access to several (but not enough during the lab) FPGAs which are
configured as MicroBlaze processors and run Linux.

The \rvex{} is a configured as a co-processor that can be controlled using a
number of memory mapped files. The is a file for writing the instruction
memory, one for reading and writing the data memory, one for reading the status
and one for writing control commands.

We abstracted this away to a small interface with the following functionality:

\begin{description}
    \item[rvexInit] \hfill \\
        Attempts to open the files. You can also specify the bytecode which
        will be written to the instruction memory.
    \item[rvexDispose] \hfill \\
        Closes all files opened by rvexInit.
    \item[rvexWrite] \hfill \\
        Allows you to write to the data memory.
    \item[rvexRead] \hfill \\
        Allows you to read from the data memory.
    \item[rvexSeek] \hfill \\
        Allows you to jump to a given position in the data memory.
    \item[rvexGo] \hfill \\
        Writes the clear and start commands to the control memory and blocks
        until the status reports that the operation was successful.
\end{description}

\section{Profiling results}

We compiled the unmodified x264 application with profiling support on a VM that
allows us to compile microblaze and \rvex{} applications.
Unfortunately we
cannot use gprof on the MicroBlaze machine itself so we ran gprof on the VM
itself.

Using the input video $\sim$/Videos/inputs/eledream\_640x360\_8.y4m we obtained
the following profiling results.

\begin{small}
\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}\end{small}

We see that the function \satd{} is called 1.6 million times during the video
conversion. These calls together take up about $14\%$ of the total time. An
equal amount of time is spent in \satd{}.

The video eledream\_640x360\_128.y4m makes the application spend about $18\%$
of the runtime in the pixel processing function and $16\%$ in \getref{}.

The bigger our input video the more time we will spend processing and the more
effect an optimization will have if it targets part of the processing code.

Judging from the profiling information there are two potential places where
optimization will be effective: \satd{} and \getref{}.

When we looked at the source code of x264 we thought that the nature of \satd{}
was more suitable for optimization because it had some loops and arithmetic in
it. The \getref{} function was a lot more irregular and also harder to
understand. On the flip side, the overhead caused by communication between the
microblaze processor and the \rvex{} would be smaller for \getref{} because it
is called three times less than \satd{}.

In the end we chose to try and put the computation of \satd{} on the
co-processor and let \getref{} for what it was.  The function \satd{} was
easier to understand and making it work was more important to us than choosing
the best optimization area right away.

\section{Endianess}

Since we had to compile for the MicroBlaze using the flag
\texttt{-DWORD-BIGENDIAN} we figured that the MicroBlaze would be a big endian
machine.  You can always test it by writing a multibyte value like
\texttt{0xDEADBEEF} to memory and read the individual bytes. If you read
\texttt{0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF} you will know that you have a big endian machine.
If you get that sequence but in reverse you know its a little endian machine.

\section{Results of using the \rvex{}}

We modified the x264 application to log its processing time computed with
\texttt{clock\_gettime}. This required linking the rt library.

Then we tried to find a fpga that was not being used by anyone else and we ran
several versions of the x264 application.  All of them included the code from
Listing~\ref{lst:timing} which allowed us to get an idea of the total runtime.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C,style=C,caption=Capturing runtime with the monotonic clock,label=lst:timing]
struct timespec tss, tse, tsd; // start, end and diff
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tss);

if( !ret )
    ret = encode( &param, &opt );

clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tse);
if (tse.tv_nsec > tss.tv_nsec) {
    tsd.tv_sec = tse.tv_sec - tss.tv_sec;
    tsd.tv_nsec = tse.tv_nsec - tss.tv_nsec;
} else {
    tsd.tv_sec = tse.tv_sec - tss.tv_sec - 1;
    tsd.tv_nsec = tse.tv_nsec - tss.tv_nsec + 1000000000;
}
printf("Took %lu.%09lu sec\n", tsd.tv_sec, tsd.tv_nsec);
\end{lstlisting}

We ran the script from Listing~\ref{lst:testscript} to get an idea of the
runtimes of the different versions.  Note that we already did manual test runs
to get an idea of how long the runs would take.  We noticed that running the
same test multiple times produced very similar run times.  We did not find it
necessary to do multiple runs for the purposes of this lab because the error
would be very small in comparison with the run times for different versions of
the application:

Most importantly, we see that our optimization actually made the application
run several times slower.  Also, we can conclude that the gcc compiler does a
terrific job at inlining functions when \texttt{-O3} is enabled, even if you do
not ask it to.  We couldnt wrap our heads around doing so much communication
related tasks in a function that was basicly a relatively small fixed number of
basic operations (*, +, -, shifts, comparisons) and achieving a faster result
by that.  We assumed that the \rvex was extremely tightly integrated into the
MicroBlaze which allowed very good communication speeds but the test results
show that this is not the case.

The speedup that we obtained can be calculated by looking at the time spent in
the kernel function. This should be about 14\% for the input video
eledream\_640x360\_8.y4m judging from the profiling results obtained on the
VM\@. We cannot say exactly how much time is spent there because we cannot
profile on the MicroBlaze.

Because the \rvex simple version took longer than 20 minutes which caused the
SSH session to hang we cannot use the exact run time. Let us see what the
speedup would be if the run time was 20 minutes exactly.

The vanilla version spends 14\% of the 75 seconds that it runs in \satd{}. So
86\% is spent in the rest of the functions. Since we have not changed anything
beside the kernel we can assume that the time spent in that part will be equal
for vanilla and for rvex simple. This means that $\frac{1200 - 0.86\cdot75}{75 -
0.86*75} = 108$ is the relative speed of the vanilla function in comparison
with the rvex version.  It actually runs 108 times faster.  In other words, the
rvex version runs 108 times slower which amounts to a speedup of -10700\%
obtained by introducing rvex.
